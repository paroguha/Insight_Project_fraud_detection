# Insight_Project_fraud_detection

- In this project I developed a ML algorithm with a cost-sensitive loss function to detect False Positives that cost credit card companies approximately 
$120 billion / year in lost revenue due to 40% customer churn, as compared tobaseline fraud detection classification algorithms that save approximately 
$40 billion in fraudulent transactions.

- I created an app using cost-sensitive classification algorithms (Logistic regression, Random Forest, and Neural Networks to classify a transaction amount 
given the card CVV and other credit card details as fraudulent.
